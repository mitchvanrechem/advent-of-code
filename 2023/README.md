## Run Solutions

In the last couple of minor Go versions, quite a few features have been added, which will undoubtedly be used in these solutions.
Assuming you have Go version 1.21.4 set up, to run any of the solutions, change into the _day_xx_ directory of your choice and run the following command:

`go run .`

The corresponding program will print the solution for each part of the day separately.

Happy coding and a merry Christmas!
